zero-to-mastery-ml is a clone of the course repo

I cloned the zero-to-mastery-ml repo.
Created a new virtual environment called 'ztm'.
With this venv, I install pandas, sklearn, numpy, and matplotlib.
Install and created a new ipykernel called 'ztm'.

Then run git init, remote, and push it to github repo:
'ztm-ml'.
This is the 'First commit'.
