pandas-intro is the copy from zero-to-mastery-ml,
since I had a problem with git errors.
I worked on different ipynb file up to section 6,
56: manipulating data 3.
Omiting the exercise.

But it was deleted when I tried to solve the git error.
I tried to get rid of the conflicting error from
my repo folder and the folder that I cloned before,
which has git inside of it.
In the end, I deleted the git on my repo,
and it deletes all the files.

To re-done that:
I cloned the zero-to-mastery-ml repo again.
Created a new virtual environment called 'ztm'.
With this venv, I install pandas, sklearn, numpy, and matplotlib.
Install and created a new ipykernel called 'ztm'.

Then run git init and push it to github repo:
'ztm-ml'.
This is the 'First commit'.
